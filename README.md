Hi !
My name is Paarth Doshi.
I have made a python program in Jupyter Notebook, that checks through computer program whether the user is wearing a mask or not.
I have taken data from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset/download?datasetVersionNumber=1

How to use this - 
Download Data from above link.
1.  Run " new_trail.ipynb " file.
2.  Now a data file name - "mask_detection_mdel.h5" will be saved in your jupyter notebook, if u want you can save this in keras format too(since its more flexible unlike h5)
3.  Run " using_trained_data.py " in jupyter notebook.
4.  Your laptop integrated camera will open and display whether you are wearing a mask or not.
5.  To Stop Pause the running code.
